# Convolutional Neural Network Test Project

This example is based on MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification problem. However, instead of classifying the handwritten digits it recreate an image of a digit when two digits are written on top of each other.

For example:

- stacked image:

![Alt](/example/stacked.png "Stacked 4 and 3")

- preddicted image:

![Alt](/example/predicted.png "Predicted image of 3")

- real answer:

![Alt](/example/real.png "Real image of 3")
